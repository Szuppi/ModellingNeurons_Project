# ModellingNeurons_Project
Importantly, the code for numerical calculations are taken from ArtemKrisanov: https://github.com/ArtemKirsanov/Youtube-Videos/2024/Elegant\ Geometry\ of\ Neural\ Computations
The visualizations (and the project as well) are inspired by the book "Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience: The Geometry of Excitability and Bursting" by Eugene M. Izhikevich: https://www.izhikevich.org/publications/dsn.pdf
